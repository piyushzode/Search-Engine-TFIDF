# Search-Engine-TFIDF

Implemented a toy "Search Engine" in Python to search the relevance of user query from a corpus of all the general election presidential debates from 1960 to 2012 (total 30 files). Calculated TF-IDF weighing for each term in every document by using NLTK (Natural language processing toolkit) for stemming and stop words removal. Then used Cosine Similarity along with TF-IDF weighing to determine the relevance of the query to the presidential debates document.

Technologies Used: Python, NLTK, Jupyter
